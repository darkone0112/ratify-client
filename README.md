# Ratify – Flutter Client

Ratify is a mobile app built for one purpose: to end the petty games around shared expenses — specifically food. Born out of frustration, distrust, and one too many "I already paid for that" lies, Ratify is your new financial watchdog.

With Ratify, you scan receipts using on-device OCR, organize them on a calendar, and let the app do the dirty work: split expenses 50/50 and show exactly who owes what — with dates, descriptions, and cold hard proof.

No more guessing. No more trust. Just receipts.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because “we’ll split everything” turns into “you paid again?”  
Because trust isn't a plan — and you’re tired of being the only one who keeps their word.  
Because you shouldn’t need to be an accountant to know if you’re being robbed.
